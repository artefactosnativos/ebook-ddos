 Kyle gathers his new allies around a makeshift campfire late one night deep within the supernatural to reveal their plan to reclaim the power stolen from them. Together, they make their intention into a nostalgic, spiritual ceremony where the promises of reclamation is cemented -- illuminated in the firelight against a canopy of stars. However, they are no more aware than ever that their mission isn't free from danger; strange, angry powers feed on in the darkness almost undetectably as they sit tucked right in, awaiting theirs claimed shifting of worlds past.
