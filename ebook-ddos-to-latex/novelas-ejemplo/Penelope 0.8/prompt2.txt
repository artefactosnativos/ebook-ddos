 Write a scene where Penelope, along with her newfound friends, travel through a remote landscape of the outback while learning of the great Dreamtime stories and legends that have been told about the area for generations. After an unexpected sandstorm hits, they stumble upon an old cave from which they find refuge, and in it, Penelope is reminded of the tales her ancestors told of great witches and gods who roamed the land.
