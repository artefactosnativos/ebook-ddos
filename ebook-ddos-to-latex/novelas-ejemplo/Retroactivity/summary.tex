Retroactivity is a novel written by award-winning American writer David Morrell. Set in Pennsylvania in the 1980s, the story centers around a home health nurse named Frances Washburn. She is tasked with caring for a peculiar family, the Buckneys, who dismiss much of the medical technology of the day in favor of relying solely on old-fashioned remedies and outdated medical books from the 1800s â€“ that if obeyed precisely, supposedly can allow them to "retroact" their well-being and heal any malady. 

Early on, things deteriorate further and profoundly as two detectives arrive to investigate the suspected murder of an elderly family visitor. Things are made more complicated as Frances gradually begins to believe their absolutist routines will do more harm than good. Through her growing suspicions, resilience, and outreachworthiness, Frances begins to positively connect with the three different agendas present in the Buckney household by conquering whatever problems that lie within. With a complex backdrop of romance and surprising mysteries awaiting in each chapter, Frances embarks on a riveting journey as she eventually pulls the cords of a familial fabric full of secrecy and deception. Fast-paced and full of surprises, Retroactivity is an entertaining and heartfelt read that will keep readers on the edge of their seats.
