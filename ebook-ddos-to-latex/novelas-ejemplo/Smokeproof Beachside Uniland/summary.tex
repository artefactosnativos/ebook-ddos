 

Lane Riley is a high school junior in Smokeproof Beachside Uniland, a private beachside winter-fall city divided into hostile art blocks. On a School Citizen Committee visit, Lane unintentionally stirs chaos and then finds peace upon discovering Floating Workshop Braindoor, an old flooded professor’s workshop left open to the public. There, she begins learning sledge-flying, a risky yet popular set of skills, from fellow teen Tiscolyn. Every few days, they make the dangerous trip together over the tiny nation’s edge, their secret outing becoming a medium for ritual between them to talk, explore, and admire their surroundings safely. Many ominous figures, both malicious and kind, enter their circle— particularly dark spirit Ang with his grip on Skundown Jaxms Net. When the two get closer, things dangerously heat up due to political unrest of special forces directed by the even greater force of Slider’s Shakedown Proner. Unraveling mystery and peril lead Lane to stand alone as a figurehead for open vision of independence— for freedom from dividers, familiarity in strangers, and enrichment in the life beyond Uniland constructed walls.
